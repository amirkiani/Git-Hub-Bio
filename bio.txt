My name is Ameer Kiani and I am a first quarter student here at Seattle Central College. I am currently pursuing an Associate's degree in Programming however as this is my first quarter, I may end liking another field in the IT department and switch my major.

I am biracial and was born in Islamabad, Pakistan. My father is Pakistani and my mother is American. I have lived on three different continents (Europe, Asia, and North America). I have been living in Seattle for about 9 months now and like it so far. I decided to seek a career in the tech field as Seattle is obviously a major tech hub and there are many well-paying job opportunities.

My work history includes working at non-profit organizations such as a wildlife refuge and a charitable school built following an earthquake. I have also worked as a call center representative and in the food service industry.

I look forward to succeeding here in SCC and in this ITC 134 class, and hopefully make new lasting professional contacts.
